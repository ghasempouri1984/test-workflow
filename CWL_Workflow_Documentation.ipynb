    "This documentation provides an overview of the Continuous Workflow Integration using GitHub Actions and Common Workflow Language (CWL). The goal of this workflow is to execute a CWL workflow on GitHub whenever a push event occurs on the main branch of the repository. In addition to the technical details, we will also explore the motivations behind implementing this workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind implementing this CWL workflow using GitHub Actions encompasses several key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automation and Continuous Integration: By setting up this workflow, we aim to automate the execution of CWL workflows whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository. This ensures that the workflow is consistently tested and executed in a controlled environment, promoting reliability and efficiency in our data analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Version Control and Collaboration: GitHub provides robust version control and collaboration features. By integrating CWL workflows with GitHub Actions, we leverage these features to manage changes, track workflow execution history, and enable collaborative development on the CWL workflows. It fosters effective teamwork and facilitates seamless contribution to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducibility and Portability: CWL is widely adopted as a standard for defining bioinformatics workflows. By utilizing CWL and running workflows through GitHub Actions, we enhance the reproducibility of our analysis pipelines. This allows other researchers to easily reproduce and validate our results, fostering scientific transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency and Scalability: GitHub Actions provides a scalable infrastructure to execute workflows on cloud-based virtual machines. This empowers us to leverage powerful computing resources and parallelize the execution of our CWL workflows. Consequently, we improve efficiency and reduce the overall execution time, enabling faster data analysis and enhancing scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ease of Setup and Configuration: GitHub Actions simplifies the setup and configuration of continuous workflows. The declarative YAML syntax used to define the workflow allows straightforward specification of desired steps, dependencies, and triggers. This ease of setup enables quick adoption and maintenance of the CWL workflow integration, streamlining development processes."
